                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What &amp; Why</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that preserve anonymity by obscuring the flow of money across their networks. With the recent crack-down on Tornado Cash, and imposed blacklists on stablecoins (Circle’s USDC), privacy coins are becoming more and more relevant. We want to explore popular privacy coins and estimate opportunities &amp; market size for privacy-based payments.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monero, Zcash, Decred, Oasis Network, Horizen, Secret, Keep Network, Phala Network, Verge, Dusk Network, PIVX, Navcoin are the most popular privacy coins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ring signatures, stealth addresses, identity masking, zero-knowledge proofs, tx-amount obfuscation are the most common technologies used by privacy coins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coins are used less for illegal activity as assumed, and more to protect personal privacy for legal payments, cross-border payments, donations, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 0.15% of all crypto transactions are related to illegal activity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coin transactions make up only 1-2% of all crypto transactions</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulation will be too tight on privacy coins, making them effectively useless (with its only use case being criminal activity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy might not be valued enough by most users, especially when compared to transaction speed or access to handouts/benefits as would be the case with CBDCs</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coins are unlikely to work with smart contracts due to their anonymous nature, and as such, will likely focus on payments exclusively</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coins are already banned in KR, AU, JP, and more countries will likely ban them at the risk of illegal activity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If regulations crack down on payment privacy, a parallel “gray” economy might emerge (and not for illegal activity, but rather just to preserve privacy)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation of CBDCs will cause a discussion around privacy, with the main argument in favor being the “greater good” and “public security” - this might become a trigger for a subset of users deciding to switch to privacy-protecting coins</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most technologies, early adopters are using the tech for shady activity, but with time mainstream users will adopt privacy tokens for day-to-day transfers</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betting on the price increase of privacy coins, relative to Bitcoin (especially as CBDC implementations are getting closer)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, privacy coins have a bad reputation of being used mostly for illegal activity, which might change rapidly once regular users start using them more and more</span></li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on NFT regulation (whether NFTs are classified as security or utility) the market might see more/less growth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global art market value is approx. 65 billion USD per year, and it is reasonable to assume the digital art market could capture 10-20% of that (similar to how Bitcoin grew to approx. 10% of Golds market value)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most NFT projects come and go quickly, with only 2 out of the top 10 projects being more than a year old (Cryptopunks and Bored Apes)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity seems to be the most significant problem for NFTs, with demand having dried up rapidly after the initial hype</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs with utility are becoming more popular, such as NFTs granting unique benefits to holders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only approx. 10% are buying NFTs for art (long-term), 90% are buying to make a profit or to flex to the community (short-term)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fractional NFTs will dominate in the future due to better liquidity and easier access to own a piece of a whole</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical assets will see more digitization through NFTs, especially with fractional NFTs enabling users to hold parts of physical assets such as land and real estate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs use cases for music, ticketing, gift cards, access passes, game items/skins will increase, while the use-case for digital art will likely grow at a slower pace</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs will have to present unique utility value, brand value (such as Nike Sneaker NFTs) or physical value (fractional real estate, etc.) to gain demand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of unknown artists releasing a collection of 10000 similar looking collectibles purely on hype are over</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for NFT collections will be highly skewed towards top projects, even more as with fungible tokens, with top 0.1-1% receiving 90-99% of all trading activity (primarily due to the lack of liquidity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming will offer the best use-case for NFTs, with tradable in-game items, skins and avatars on the blockchain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-end/luxury market will see an increase in NFT demand, especially when combined with brand value and perceived uniqueness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin could become the most dominant way to issue NFTs (via the Taro protocol on the Lightning Network)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many 2017 alt-tokens saw their demand increase once again during the 2021 bull market, most NFT projects released in 2021/2022 will likely die (due to lack of fractional liquidity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unlikely that NFTs will receive as much hype as they did in 2021 ever again - we expect that NFT demand will slowly recover to all-time-highs, although over many years and with drastically different use-cases (mostly powered by gaming and virtual economy)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs will be based on the actual value they represent (such as ticket value, digital fractions of physical assets, in-game item/skin, access/governance passes), as opposed to speculative art value except in a few rare cases</span></li>

                <h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What &amp; Why</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have been in discussion recently by the Federal Reserve and ECB, with China, Russia, and India having already launched some form of CBDC.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs are digital payment systems, with users owning accounts directly with the central bank (instead of intermediary banks). Central banks have exclusive control over the digital currency, which raises questions about potential abuse of power and dangers such as Orwellian control, surveillance, and censorship.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Questions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are the advantages/disadvantages of CBDCs compared to Bitcoin?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are the advantages/disadvantages of CBDCs compared to the current way banks work?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How dangerous are CBDCs regarding freedom, free speech &amp; censorship?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How likely will central banks introduce negative interest rates to promote spending?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How likely will central banks start to promote social credit type of schemes?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is there a danger in central banks using the collected payment data against users?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Can inflation control and GDP growth be controlled better with CBDCs?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is the tradeoff between the efficiency of digital money vs. censorship and control?</span></li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimistic Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs will offer better safety for the majority of the population due to the simple way to track and intervene</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since CBDCs are provided by a single institution, it will be easy to interlink CBDCs with each other, offering efficient and cheap cross-border payment solutions</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People will not see any difference between credit cards and CBDCs (possibly even benefits in payment speed and cost)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People will likely receive “free money” to switch from existing systems (the switch will happen at the perceived free will of people)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs are the dream for socialist-driven politics, and naturally, a large part of society will openly and enthusiastically welcome CBDCs with their potential benefits for the “greater good”</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs provide an excellent narrative for owning gold and crypto (and will likely trigger the largest bull run for these hard assets that provide privacy and ownership control)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prevents counterfeiting, avoidance of crime/tax evasion, more financial inclusion</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Direct cash injections benefitting (in the short-term) individual races, groups, or well-behaving people according to policies that central authorities want to encourage</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Negative interest rates to encourage spending and increase the velocity of money</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Programmable money, open APIs for 3rd party developers, easier (although automatic) taxation through automatic deductions from accounts</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tax authorities can drastically reduce their staff and operational expenses since taxes can be easily calculated and deducted automatically (same applies for credited tax refunds)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A massive demand for privacy/payment-oriented cryptocurrencies that are truly trustless &amp; decentralized (people will vote with their behavior and eventually replace centralized CBDCs due to declining purchasing power and impractical policies/regulations)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The free market/open source developers will be more agile and reactive to real-time demands by users (e-CNY is inferior to WeChat pay and Alipay), causing users to prefer cryptos over CBDCs out of convenience</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Getting users to change from credit cards/cryptos to CBDCs (including installing apps, identification software, etc.) will require immense upfront incentives such as money handouts (or an orchestrated panic, either via a cyber attack on financial systems or massive market crash)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is unlikely CBDCs will gain broad acceptance due to inconvenience unless the public is forced to use them (it will be a battle between forced agenda and human nature)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pessimistic Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A social credit system is the logical next step after having complete control over people’s spending data</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CO2/energy credits and similar consumption credits can be easily enforced and likely will be enforced</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A total ban on cash and cryptos, making CBDC use mandatory through regulation (if people are given the option to decide, CBDCs will unlikely gain acceptance as seen with eCNY)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">All intermediary banks will go bankrupt through an orchestrated financial crash, and unlike in 2008 these banks won’t be rescued</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs encourage central planning, with governments likely overstepping into socialist/full control measures (it is almost impossible for free markets to flourish with authoritarian control by one party over the payment layer)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the obvious incompetence by central banks, it is almost guaranteed that CBDCs will turn out horribly for people (with all the expected dangers like censorship, frozen accounts, and social credit systems)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs will cause sanctions against individuals, companies, and nations, who don’t comply with the policies of central authorities</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Control over payments, connected to the rise of artificial intelligence (facial recognition, etc.) poses a threat to freedom, with some form of social credit system being only a matter of time</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The balance sheets of central banks are technically infinite and don’t need to be balanced with assets; hence central banks can create money even easier than before and hand it out based on policies/narratives instead of real economic value</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Progressive taxation based on usage (gas/energy, meat consumption, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gives the central bank complete control over means of production, using artificial intelligence to evaluate the collected payment data (a socialists dream) - USSR top-down centrally planned market failed because decisions were based on delayed estimates &amp; incomplete information - CBDC real-time evaluation of payment data could cause a centrally planned economy that actually appears to work</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No competition between banks to offer better terms, service, interest rates, etc.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Automatic deductions of penalties from accounts, whether in the form of one-time deduction (speeding ticket) or varying debit based on some formula (CO2 credits, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs will be introduced to the market by providing extensive handouts and significant incentives (to get people to change the status quo)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long-term effects of CBDC handouts will likely cause massive inflation and inefficiencies (that interventionists will try to resolve through more policies &amp; regulations)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Transition to CBDCs will be met with a lot of resistance (especially in the West), but will eventually be forced upon people through strictly outlawing cash (rhetoric will change as it did with the requirement of vaccines, from voluntary and recommended to mandatory for the greater good fighting yet another invisible enemy)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The next logical step after CBDCs (or parallel to it) is the introduction of an identification system for users (accessible as API for 3rd parties) - this comes with additional dangers in regards to privacy, access control, and censorship</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs will likely become transitory currencies that people will try to exchange for hard assets (like in AR/CU/VE)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As long as the government &amp; central banks are honest, CBDCs seem like an advantage, however, if governments start abusing the additional power for their own interest, the downsides massively outweigh the upsides of a CBDC</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stimulus checks/UBI will become the norm for income while the workforce is slowly replaced by AI &amp; redundant labor</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs are more restrictive and provide less utility than cryptos, making them the unpopular choice compared to cryptos and other digital payment methods</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The central bank will be the sole trusted authority and prone to internal/external cyber attacks and other “single points of failure” that could be largely avoided in a decentralized/trustless system</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Central banks are intentionally discrediting the innovation around cryptocurrencies (decentralization, openness, privacy) to maintain control and power</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrencies (especially payment &amp; privacy-oriented ones) will be regulated out of existence (or made inaccessible by most people), since they compete directly with CBDCs</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Opportunities</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long payment cryptocurrencies for crypto adoption (Bitcoin with its lightning network)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long privacy cryptocurrencies for privacy narrative (Monero, Zcash, Verge, Navcoin)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Short banks/payment companies for replacement narrative (JPM, BAC, WFC, PYPL)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exit the traditional banking system (gold, self-sufficiency, geographical diversification)</span></li>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Risks</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Satoshi selling their stake of 1 million Bitcoins</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin being exposed as US government experiment, making RU/CN more suspicious of it</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Extremely harsh regulations (consumer protection, environment, securities laws)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Competition with government-issued digital currencies</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tighter controls around Internet access</span></li>

<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Network attacks and mining centralization</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anti-Proof of Work regulations</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Harsh securities laws applied to most crypto tokens</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Statistically likely that underlying tech fails or becomes exploited</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not enough demand for “digital gold”</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not enough performance to compete with centralized payment systems (CBDC)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No narratives to drive subsequent bull runs</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimistic Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto &amp; DeFi operate alongside central bank currencies successfully</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs handle the payment layer, while DeFi/crypto handles all layer-2 applications</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin is successfully maintained, despite all security risks, enabling it to survive for the foreseeable future</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin gains acceptance as digital Gold and adoption grows for individuals, companies, governments</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin is just at the beginning of an S-curve adoption, with early adopters using the technology exclusively so far (we will see a massive adoption over the next 20-30 years)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Adoption will be driven by India, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where most users just come online and have yet to discover the power of frictionless payments</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin will become easy-to-use, extremely fast with cheap fees through a layer-2 solution like the lightning network</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin will be denominated in sats, increasing the perception of owning “cheaper” Bitcoin</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto will build upon its strong values (trustlessness, anti-censorship, decentralization), out-competing CBDCs, which are trying to regulate, control, and censor their users</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pessimistic Predictions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto struggles to gain adoption as central bank digital currencies push it out of the market</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto will become too regulated in regards to privacy, access (only professional investors), environmental laws, securities laws</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A black-swan event (see risks) destroys all confidence in the early cryptocurrencies</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">End-users don’t care about decentralization</span></li>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In each crypto cycle, new narratives begin to drive and lead the bull market. In 2017, ICOs, mining, masternodes, Chinese market tokens (NEO, Qtum, Vechain), unique L1s (DAGs such as Iota/Raiblocks), and Bitcoin as “digital gold” were the main narratives for the bull market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021/2022 cycle began with DeFi and quickly turned into an incredible run for NFTs, metaverse, lending, staking, and yield farming narratives. Most notably, the 2021/2022 bull run was driven by meme tokens (promotion of Dogecoin by Elon) and the emergence of Binance Smart Chain (Safemoon), letting anyone launch tokens based on hype (shilled to financially uneducated Gen-Z on TikTok and Instagram).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads us to the question of whether we can predict the narrative that will drive the next bull market or even grow uncorrelated to Bitcoin. From all our bets, we want to share one big hypothesis for the coming bull market, betting on potentially upcoming regulations: stronger asset security laws, ESG, environment, cannabis, and payments with strong usability (CBDC alternatives).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both the 2017 bull market and the 2021/2022 bull market, many people lost money by investing in ICOs/tokens that are nothing but unregistered securities. These tokens will likely be regulated out of the market or sold to zero by continuous sell pressure from founders/early investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that coins definitively passing the Howey test will be considered valuable (again), especially tokens that have passed the test of time with an organic distribution (=no presale). We call this the OG Token Hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are these particular OG tokens? Tokens that were launched 8-10 years ago without a presale and distributed via mining or staking. Candidates include Dogecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, Vertcoin, Reddcoin, Nxt, Navcoin, Blackcoin, Hempcoin, Potcoin, and similar. These have a rich history, some even very active development, and mature communities.</span></p>
<h3>Why OG Tokens?</h3>
<p>Let’s look at some arguments which might contribute to possible narratives around these “OG tokens.”</p>

<p>- Blockchains operating since 2012/2013 - some of the oldest blockchains after Bitcoin<br>- Owning part of crypto history as a fungible token (with better liquidity than NFTs)<br>- Unlikely classified as security! (Any security regulation will be favorable for these tokens)<br>- Were top 10 once (brand value), crypto OGs know Peercoin, Namecoin, Feathercoin, etc.<br>- Peercoin as the first-proof-of-stake coin, Namecoin as the first blockchain focused on identity &amp; asset registry.<br>- Peercoin &amp; Namecoin at ~15m market cap, Navcoin at ~3m market cap, - Feathercoin at ~2m market cap (compared to Litecoin, Dogecoin at a multi-billion dollar market cap)<br>- Passing the test of time with 8-10 years of history<br>- Active development (<a href="https://github.com/peercoin">Peercoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vertcoin-project">Vertcoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CoinBlack">Blackcoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NAVCoin">Navcoin</a>)<br>- Potential listings on large exchanges if interest grows again<br>- Potential narratives around first-proof-of-stake, ESG, and environment/green tokens (Peercoin) - especially if Washington and - - Brussels decide to penalize PoW mining<br>- Potential narratives around cannabis legalization (Hempcoin, Potcoin)- Hash-rate is slowly growing (with a recent boost by ETH switching to PoS)<br>- Potential narratives around privacy-oriented blockchains (Navcoin)<br>- Largely governed by the community (with oversight by foundations, for example the <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/foundation">Peercoin Foundation</a>, which <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/assets/reports/Stichting_Peercoin_Foundation_-_Jaarrekening_2021.pdf">publishes yearly financial reports</a><br>- Highly distributed <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ppc/#!rich">Peercoin has 53,639 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-namecoin-addresses.html">Namecoin has 52,146 addresses</a>, <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!rich">Navcoin has 25,065 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-blackcoin-addresses.html">Blackcoin 19,336 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-feathercoin-addresses.html">Feathercoin has 12,579 addresses</a></p>
<h3>Risks and Concerns</h3>
<p>Our biggest concern is the lack of liquidity for these tokens (which will also cause a massive supply shortage in case the proposed narrative starts gaining traction). Many of these tokens are listed only on Bittrex or exchanges that are old and not used by recent crypto entrants. Larger exchanges don’t want to deal with the maintenance of small market cap blockchains. This isn’t likely to change unless the market demands it, as was the case with Dogecoin.</p>
<h3>Prices</h3>
<p>Let us create a paper portfolio of some low market cap picks and track them over a few years relative to BTC. We believe the risk/reward is incredibly high, likely above 10:1 for a multi-year holding period. We also acknowledge that some of our picks (statistically, as history shows) might experience hacks or dump to zero over a long enough horizon. Regardless, we think the tokens that make it will compensate for the losses.<br><br>Sample portfolio, with prices as of Oct 6th 2022. <br>Peercoin - $0.55<br>Namecoin - $1.10<br>Navcoin - $0.046<br>Feathercoin - $0.0077<br>Blackcoin - $0.015<br>Hempcoin - $0.0027<br>Potcoin - $0.0032</p>
