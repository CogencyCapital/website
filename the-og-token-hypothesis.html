In 2017, ICOs, mining, masternodes, Chinese market tokens (NEO, Qtum, Vechain), unique L1s (DAGs such as Iota/Raiblocks), and Bitcoin as “digital gold” were the main narratives for the bull market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021/2022 cycle began with DeFi and quickly turned into an incredible run for NFTs, metaverse, lending, staking, and yield farming narratives. Most notably, the 2021/2022 bull run was driven by meme tokens (promotion of Dogecoin by Elon) and the emergence of Binance Smart Chain (Safemoon), letting anyone launch tokens based on hype (shilled to financially uneducated Gen-Z on TikTok and Instagram).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads us to the question of whether we can predict the narrative that will drive the next bull market or even grow uncorrelated to Bitcoin. From all our bets, we want to share one big hypothesis for the coming bull market, betting on potentially upcoming regulations: stronger asset security laws, ESG, environment, cannabis, and payments with strong usability (CBDC alternatives).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both the 2017 bull market and the 2021/2022 bull market, many people lost money by investing in ICOs/tokens that are nothing but unregistered securities. These tokens will likely be regulated out of the market or sold to zero by continuous sell pressure from founders/early investors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that coins definitively passing the Howey test will be considered valuable (again), especially tokens that have passed the test of time with an organic distribution (=no presale). We call this the OG Token Hypothesis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are these particular OG tokens? Tokens that were launched 8-10 years ago without a presale and distributed via mining or staking. Candidates include Dogecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, Vertcoin, Reddcoin, Nxt, Navcoin, Blackcoin, Hempcoin, Potcoin, and similar. These have a rich history, some even very active development, and mature communities.</span></p><h3>Why OG Tokens?</h3><p>Let’s look at some arguments which might contribute to possible narratives around these “OG tokens.”</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/token-snapshot.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-xs.png 300w, https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-sm.png 480w, https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-md.png 768w, https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-lg.png 1024w, https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-xl.png 1360w, https://cogency.capital/media/posts/2/responsive/token-snapshot-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="2850" height="1460"></figure><p>- Blockchains operating since 2012/2013 - some of the oldest blockchains after Bitcoin<br>- Owning part of crypto history as a fungible token (with better liquidity than NFTs)<br>- Unlikely classified as security! (Any security regulation will be favorable for these tokens)<br>- Were top 10 once (brand value), crypto OGs know Peercoin, Namecoin, Feathercoin, etc.<br>- Peercoin as the first-proof-of-stake coin, Namecoin as the first blockchain focused on identity &amp; asset registry.<br>- Peercoin &amp; Namecoin at ~15m market cap, Navcoin at ~3m market cap, - Feathercoin at ~2m market cap (compared to Litecoin, Dogecoin at a multi-billion dollar market cap)<br>- Passing the test of time with 8-10 years of history<br>- Active development (<a href="https://github.com/peercoin">Peercoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vertcoin-project">Vertcoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CoinBlack">Blackcoin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NAVCoin">Navcoin</a>)<br>- Potential listings on large exchanges if interest grows again<br>- Potential narratives around first-proof-of-stake, ESG, and environment/green tokens (Peercoin) - especially if Washington and - - Brussels decide to penalize PoW mining<br>- Potential narratives around cannabis legalization (Hempcoin, Potcoin)<br>- Hash-rate is slowly growing (with a recent boost by ETH switching to PoS)<br>- Largely governed by the community (with oversight by foundations, for example the <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/foundation">Peercoin Foundation</a>, which <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/assets/reports/Stichting_Peercoin_Foundation_-_Jaarrekening_2021.pdf">publishes yearly financial reports</a><br>- Highly distributed <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ppc/#!rich">Peercoin has 53,639 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-namecoin-addresses.html">Namecoin has 52,146 addresses</a>, <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/#!rich">Navcoin has 25,065 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-blackcoin-addresses.html">Blackcoin 19,336 addresses</a>, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-feathercoin-addresses.html">Feathercoin has 12,579 addresses</a></p><h3>Risks and Concerns</h3><p>Our biggest concern is the lack of liquidity for these tokens (which will also cause a massive supply shortage in case the proposed narrative starts gaining traction). Many of these tokens are listed only on Bittrex or exchanges that are old and not used by recent crypto entrants. Larger exchanges don’t want to deal with the maintenance of small market cap blockchains. This isn’t likely to change unless the market demands it, as was the case with Dogecoin.</p><h3>Prices</h3><p>Let us create a paper portfolio of some low market cap picks and track them over a few years relative to BTC. We believe the risk/reward is incredibly high, likely above 10:1 for a multi-year holding period. We also acknowledge that some of our picks (statistically, as history shows) might experience hacks or dump to zero over a long enough horizon. Regardless, we think the tokens that make it will compensate for the losses.<br><br>Sample portfolio, with prices as of Oct 6th 2022. <br>Peercoin - $0.55<br>Namecoin - $1.10<br>Navcoin - $0.046<br>Feathercoin - $0.0077<br>Blackcoin - $0.015<br>Hempcoin - $0.0027<br>Potcoin - $0.0032</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://cogency.capital/authors/cogency-capital/" rel="author">Cogency Capital</a></h3><p>Cogency Capital focuses on narrative &amp; trend-based investments using quantitative methods.
